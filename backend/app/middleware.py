"""Security headers + rate limiting, applied in main.py.

Not a Node/Express app, so there's no literal "helmet" package to reach
for -- SecurityHeadersMiddleware below sets the same class of headers
helmet does, by hand, since that's a handful of lines and avoids pulling
in a dependency for something this small.

Rate limiting is slowapi (a FastAPI-oriented wrapper around `limits`) --
the de facto choice here, same as Flask-Limiter is for Flask. `limiter`
is a single shared instance imported by main.py (to register the
exception handler + default limit) and by any router that wants a
stricter limit than the default on a specific route.
